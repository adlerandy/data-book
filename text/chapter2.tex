\chapter{Medical Measurements


At rest, the heart
consumes about 20\% of
the body's energy. In an
average adult, it
transports 6\,L/min (=0.1\,L/s) to a
pressure of 120\,mmHg ($\approx$ 20\,kPa) and an output power of 2\,W. 
Efficient pumping requires precise coordonation of the heart muscles and a rhythmic heart beat. 

A healthy heart is in
\emph{sinus rhythm{ an almost -- but not quite -- perfect rhythm. In fact, before the invention the of pendulum, the heart beat was the best clock available.
Variations in  heart
rhythms are caused by
heart diseases, but also
external challenges like
stress and exercise.
